## Motivate: A Native MacOS App

This is a minimal, native app written entirely in C++ and wxWidgets and built in Xcode. It can help you track your accomplishments. For me personally, this project is a small wrap-up after working with C++/wxWidgets during my Summer 2019 internship.

`motivateApp` is the executable with a `.app` extension.

To build this in Xcode, you will need to run `brew install wxwidgets`.
